      <h2 class="text-center mb-4" style="color:#2e7d32">Introduction to Purple Hyacinth Bean Vine</h2>
      <p>The Purple Hyacinth Bean Vine (<em>Lablab purpureus</em>) is a fast-growing, ornamental climbing vine celebrated for its vibrant purple flowers and shiny seed pods. As a member of the legume family, it is both visually striking and versatile in its uses. While primarily grown for its ornamental value, some parts of the plant are edible with proper preparation. Always research edibility carefully before consuming any plant.</p>
      <p>Ideal for trellises, arbors, fences, and pergolas, this vine provides a quick summer screen or shade. Its rapid growth and stunning appearance make it a favorite among gardeners looking to add vertical interest to their landscapes.</p>

    <section id="site-selection" class="mt-5">
      <h2 class="text-center mb-4" style="color:#2e7d32">Site Selection and Soil</h2>
      <p><strong>Light Requirements:</strong> Purple Hyacinth Bean Vine thrives in full sun, requiring at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily for prolific flowering and pod production. While it can tolerate partial shade, flowering will be reduced.</p>
      <p><strong>Soil Preferences:</strong> This vine prefers well-drained, rich, loamy soil with a neutral pH (6.0 to 6.8). To improve soil fertility, work in organic matter such as compost before planting.</p>
      <p><strong>Location Considerations:</strong> Choose a site with plenty of room for vertical growth, as the vine can reach heights of 20+ feet. Ensure good air circulation, especially in humid climates, to prevent fungal issues. Avoid planting near heat sinks like hot walls in very warm regions.</p>

    <section id="planting" class="mt-5">
      <h2 class="text-center mb-4" style="color:#2e7d32">Planting</h2>
      <p><strong>When to Plant:</strong> In the UK, Purple Hyacinth Bean Vine should be planted after all danger of frost has passed, typically in late May or early June. Evening temperatures should consistently remain above 10°C (50°F).</p>
      <p><strong>Starting from Seed:</strong> Soak hard seeds overnight in water to soften them and hasten germination. Direct sow seeds outdoors 1-2 inches deep and no more than 6 inches apart. Water thoroughly and keep the soil consistently moist until germination occurs (2-3 weeks).</p>
      <p><strong>Starting Indoors:</strong> Start seeds indoors 4-6 weeks before the last expected frost, which is usually in late March or early April in the UK. Plant pre-soaked seeds about 0.5 inches deep in seed-starting mix. Keep moist in a warm, bright location and harden off seedlings for a week before transplanting outdoors in late May or early June.</p>
      <p><strong>Support Structure:</strong> Provide a sturdy trellis, fence, or other climbing support at planting time. Train young vines to find the support to prevent tangling.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="care-maintenance" class="mt-5">
      <h2 class="text-center mb-4" style="color:#2e7d32">Care and Maintenance</h2>
      <p><strong>Watering:</strong> Purple Hyacinth Bean Vine prefers consistent moisture but not waterlogged conditions. Water deeply when the top 3 inches of soil feel dry, and increase watering frequency during hot, dry spells.</p>
      <p><strong>Fertilizing:</strong> Feed the vine every 4-5 weeks during summer with an organic fertilizer high in phosphorus to encourage flowering and pod production. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which promotes leafy growth over flowers.</p>
      <p><strong>Pruning:</strong> Minimal pruning is needed, mainly for shaping or managing size. Flowers should be left on the vine to develop into ornamental pods. In warm climates, cut back vines to 6 inches late in the season to encourage a second flush of growth and blooms.</p>
      <p><strong>Pests and Diseases:</strong> While generally robust, watch for common garden pests and fungal diseases in shaded, high-humidity conditions. Ensure good air circulation to mitigate disease outbreaks.</p>

      <h2 class="text-center mb-4" style="color:#2e7d32">Flowering and Pod Production</h2>
      <p><strong>Bloom Time:</strong> In the UK, Purple Hyacinth Bean Vine typically blooms from July through September, depending on planting time and weather conditions. Pods follow quickly after flowers fade, adding ornamental value to the plant.</p>
      <p><strong>Encouraging Blooms:</strong> Ensure full sun exposure and avoid excessive nitrogen fertilizer to promote flowering over leafy growth.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="seed-saving" class="mt-5">
      <h2 class="text-center mb-4" style="color:#2e7d32">End of Season / Seed Saving</h2>
      <p><strong>Frost Sensitivity:</strong> Purple Hyacinth Bean Vine is not frost-tolerant, and growth will cease with the first hard frost, typically in October or November in the UK.</p>
      <p><strong>Seed Saving:</strong> Allow pods to mature and dry on the vine. Collect seeds once pods are brown and brittle. Store seeds in a cool, dry place for planting next season.</p>
